# Machine Learning and Quantum Diamond Magnetometry applied to Object Monitoring

My flagstaff project as a research fellow at The University of Melbourne combined **Machine Learning** architectures with experimental **Quantum Sensing** to solve a real-life problem: **monitor the position of an object using magnetic fields**. 

Magnetic sensing is a powerful technique that complements others like Global Positioning System (GPS) in the field of object monitoring. It is particularly interesting in application where GPS signals are denied, such as **indoors, underground or underwater**, because **magnetic signals can propagate in these environments**. Also, **magnetic tracking does not require that the target is equipped with a receiver**, which broadens the application scenarios for this technology.

The **major challenge for magnetic sensing**, however, comes with the **data analysis and interpretation**. Usually, magnetic information has a complex signature convoluted with the environmental noise, requiring sophiticated physical models and calculations that allow a precise interpretation to correlate the position of an object with its magnetic signal. **In this project**, we solve this problem by developing a **Machine Learning algorithm that learns to predict the position of an object based on magnetic measurements without the need of any physical models**.
